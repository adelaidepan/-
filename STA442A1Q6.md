6. In the United States, admission to university is based partly on high school marks and
recommendations, and partly on applicants' performance on a standardized multiple
choice test called the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The SAT has two sub-tests, Ver-
bal and Math. A university administrator selected a random sample of 200 applicants,
and recorded the Verbal SAT, the Math SAT and rst-year university Grade Point
Average (GPA) for each student. The data are given SAT data le. The university
administrator knows that the Verbal and Math SAT tests have the same number of
questions, and the maximum score on both is 800. But are they equally difficult on
average for this population of students?
Using R, do a reasonable analysis to answer the question. You can read the data into
a data frame with
    
```
sat = read.table("http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/~brunner/data/legal/openSAT.data.txt")
```
    
Bring your printout to the quiz; you may be asked to hand it in. Be ready to

-State your model.
-Justify your choice of model. Would you expect Verbal and Math scores from the
same student to be independent?
-State your null and alternative hypotheses, in symbols.
-Express your conclusion (if any) in plain, non-statistical language that could be
understood by someone who never had a Statistics course. Your answer is some-
thing about which test is more dicult for these students. Marks will be deducted
for use of technical terms like null hypothesis, signicance level, critical value, p-
value, and so on even if what you say is correct.
    
There is more than one correct answer to this question. I did the analysis several
dierent ways, and I consider all of them correct. I can think of about ve more
acceptable ways that I did not try. The number of bad ways to analyze the data is
virtually unlimited.
